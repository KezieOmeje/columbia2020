    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with some basic questions. First, the term *computational journalism.* What does it mean for journalism to be computational? Over the last few decades, computers have become part of our everyday lives. They regulate and shape our interactions with the physical and virtual worlds. Organizations increasingly equate (though not without problems) \"data release\" with transparency. Sensing (sound, light, air quality) is cheap and plentiful, and easily deployed by the general public. Our actions online generate vast quantities of digital data. And, increasingly, computer systems exercise real power in the world through the insertion of machine learning (statistical models, artificial intelligence) alongside or in place of human decision making. In all of this, we can find new ways to ask questions about the world, how it's organized and how it functions. But the keys to this new digitized kingdom are data, code and algorithms. The curiosity, the questioning spirit, you developed last semester in your reporting classes finds an outlet in new and unexpected ways, mediated by data, code and algorithms. Hence, *computational journalism.* It is simply a response to our new condition of living in a computational society.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this year's edition of the course, we will be focusing on computational tools and techniques that, while not necessarily new, certainly achieved new prominence in the national election in 2016 and beyond. The vast networks of information that are created every day are simply too large for us to examine in their entirety. To get a sense of \"what's on,\" we take feeds from algorithmic recommender systems, we scan trending topics, we focus on information shared with us by our friends or people we trust. Recently, we have seen how these tools and strategies for directing our attention can be hacked. This year, we are going to place special emphasis on understanding machine learning or artificial intelligence and how it impacts journalism — from helping your reporting, to creating new kinds of story forms, to its use in the distribution of journalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our course is part of a city-wide effort to create new technologies, to look for new kinds of stories, that respond to this new societal condition, to these \"threats to journalism.\" There are five major New York City Universities involved: Columbia, Cornell Tech, The New School, Queens College and NYU. We are a mix of engineers, journalists and media studies students. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the all-city class syllabus:\n",
    "\n",
    ">How does the information ecosystem contribute to the health of representative democracies such as the United States? How do we move towards communities that are equipped with the knowledge and deliberation mechanisms required to address the challenges that face us? How does the relationship between technology platforms, media, governments and citizens determine which voices get heard?\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "These are some of the central questions that will animate Tech, Media & Democracy 2020. This course will bring together students with backgrounds in engineering, computer science, design, journalism and other relevant disciplines to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. New investigative tools to build our understanding of technology, media and social issues;\n",
    "The current structures, mechanisms and designs of our information ecosystem platforms and their impact on informed society outcomes;\n",
    "2. How media, propaganda and misinformation impact knowledge and participation in the functions of democracy, such as elections and the census;\n",
    "3. How the voices of vulnerable populations of people- such as minorities, immigrants and the poor- fare in our information and media landscape;\n",
    "4. The decline of local journalism, its effect on the health of communities and what can be done to repair it. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The city-wide course sessions will feature ten joint group lectures and activities taking place on Monday nights across New York City at the participating universities; a hackathon that will compel teams to develop solutions to the problems posed in the course; and an opportunity to present prototype solutions publicly at the close of the semester. The goal of the course is to bring diverse perspectives to these challenging problems.\n",

    "### Class Themes\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we will cover a variety of topics that will help you in your journalistic practice, both in the sense that you better understand the media \"ecology\" you interact with daily, but also we will teach you to look to these systems as a source of stories, and even perhaps as a source of inspiration to build some kind of new platform to support journalism. We will learn a variety of tools, and our primary programming language will be Python. We will talk through how we came to this decision, but for the moment, know that it is a flexible language that lets you easily connect to networks like Twitter, assemble and analyze data from formal databases and the web, and build responsive services based on all these inputs. Over the next few months, we will introduce you to the following technologies and tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python programming\n",
    "* Basic data analysis\n",
    "* Data collection using APIs and [scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)\n",
    "* Machine Learning: ML to report on, ML to report with and ML as a distribution tool\n",
    "* Bots (text and voice)\n",
    "* Regular Expressions and command-line tools\n",
    "* Data Visualization\n",
    "* Database technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Our class typically attracts people with different skill levels, most having no background in computation, some having recently been introduced to Python, and occasionally one or two who are already proficient in many of the topics we are covering. The course assignments will be structured in ways that everyone has something new to do, with those needing less in the way of a technical introduction focusing on applications to reporting or the work of journalism broadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python from within this \"notebook\" framework. The notebook is an ideal way to address you journalistic and programming needs. Beyond simply commenting on what\n",
    "your code is doing, these notebooks are a legitimate authoring system that you will use\n",
    "to create (and publish) pitches and memos for this class. One of your humble instructors has [lectured on why the Jupyter notebook is ideal for journalists.](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/70966)"

    "### Why we code\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this course is to introduce computation, broadly defined, as a tool for both finding and telling stories. This mean \"reporting on\" computation and its role in the world, as well as \"reporting with\" computing tools in pursuit of a story — and any combination of the two.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When teaching computation (or any \"technology\") as part of a course, people often refer to \"literacy\" as a goal. For the most part, that term implies \"functional literacy\" — do you understand how to use something? Can you write a program, say, to assemble a data set from the web? \n",
    "\n",
    "Stuart Selber, a professor of English at Penn State, writes about two other facets to being literate. After functional literacy, he defines \"critical literacy.\" Here are characteristics of a critically literate student.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Design cultures.* A critically literate student scrutinizes the dominant perspectives that shape computer design cultures and their artifacts.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "*Use contexts.* A critically literate student sees use contexts as an inseperable aspect of computers that helps to contextualize and constitute them.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "*Institutional forces.* A critically literate student understands the institutional forces that shape computer use.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "*Popular representations.* A critically literate student scrutinizes representations of \n",
    "computers in the public imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third kind of literacy is \"rhetorical.\" \n",
    "\n",
    ">*Persuasion.* A rhetorically literate student understands that persuasion permeates interface design contexts in both implicit and explicit ways and that it always involves larger structures and forces (e.g., use contexts, ideology).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "*Deliberation.* A rhetorically literate student understands that interface design problems are ill-defined problems whose solutions are representational arguments that have been arrived at through various deliberative activities.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "*Reflection.* A rhetorically literate student articulates his or her interface design knowledge at a conscious level and subjects their actions and practices to critical assessment.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "*Social action.* A rhetorically literate student sees interface design as a form of social versus technical action.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the standpoint of a journalism student, all of this might best be wrapped up in the following equivalences (shamelessly cribbed from Ian Bogost at Georgia Tech).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<center><b>Digital Technology = Model of the World  = Argument</b></center>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In short, every piece of digital technology embeds within it a model of the world. You might think of this as the dominant \"use case\" a designer had in mind. The net effect is that some actions are natural, \"designed for\", easy, while others are hard. And this is the argument. It is the way that technology trains you to adopt its conventions, its embedded model of the world. You are led to do the easy things and avoid the hard things. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will spend a great deal of time learning a programming language, Python. And yes, any given coding language has its own model of the world and makes its own arguments for certain kinds of practices (certain metaphors for actually writing code). But with a coding language comes almost unbounded flexibility to create. Unlike many of the designed systems we interact with, coding gives us the freedom to build, to imagine the world in new ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these ideas take on particular resonance with our theme, \"Hacking your attention.\" We are inviting you to not only investigate existing algorithms for computing \"trending topics,\" but also to try out your own ideas about how this should be done. In an age when people are arguing for \"algorithmic accountability\" and \"explainable\" artificial intelligence\", it's the perfect time to consider a reporting practice that investigates by building.

    "**Each week**, you will receive notebooks, like this one, that you will work through outside of class. They will usually be due before the next class meeting, but specific deadlines will be given with each. There will be one or two per week and their level of detail will depend on the material. Sometimes they will be more drill-like, and other times they will challenge you to create something new. But don't worry, we do not assume you know anything about Python, in particular, or coding, in general. \n",

    "**You may work on your assignment in groups, but you should answer any questions in your own words. No copying. It is important that we see how well you are understanding the material.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, **each week beginning February 17** you will find a story or some technology (program, platform, web site) that deals with the themes of the class. You will write a summary/critique, and contribute it to the course Tumblr page. To help you, here are the kinds of questions you might address about a story you read.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the story about? Use no more than two sentences.\n",
    "2. What drew you to this story, and why does it enhance our class discussion?\n",
    "3. What data is used in the story, if any? How did the journalist obtain the data?\n",
    "4. How did the computing help in telling the story? Who performed the computations?\n",
    "5. Did the journalist \"show their work\" and could you recreate their results?\n",
    "6. What non-computing sources were used, and how do they contribute to the story?\n",
    "7. What would you do to follow up on this story? Where would you go next? \n",
    "\n",
    "These writeups are **due by 5pm Monday evenings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The class will culminate in a final project, the largest component of your grade.** You will work in groups of 2-3 students. Your project is meant to be an act of computational journalism. This might mean building and documenting a new data set or computing service, or using computation to probe an existing platform or data set to tell a new story. No matter what path is chosen, we expect a well-written, well-reported story memo that accompanies your analysis or technology development. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A significant story pitch describing your project is due Monay, March 30 by 5pm.** This should be of sufficient detail that it’s clear you will have a strong, finished project by the end of the term — you might have started building something, reporting on something and analyzing data, etc. The purpose of this midterm check-in is to avoid end-of-term surprises as data fall through, holes emerge or analyses break down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each Wednesday by 5pm beginning February 17,** students will update a Jupyter notebook corresponding to their final project. Initially, this might consist entirely of text and straight-up reporting, along with questions about a story idea and how to proceed. It might also consist of computations and progress toward a final story memo. We expect just one update per group. And we understand that groups will shift during this period. We just want to see that people are thinking about their projects early.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Grades will be divided between weekly writing assignments (computing or data story\n",
    "writeups and project updates), weekly coding drills, your final project, and attendance/\n",
    "participation. **We expect you to submit complete each of these by the deadline.** If you are having trouble keeping up, let us know right away. **We expect you to attend every class, including the TMD joint classes.** Here is how grading breaks down.\n",

    "Python is a programming language created by a guy, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum). van Rossum began work on Python in the late 1980s and version 1.0 was released in 1994. Python now has a considerable development community and you can find important resources at the [Python web site.](https://www.python.org/) According to that site, Python is \"a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Those problems include  string manipuation — looking at the words or sentences in a document, say. Python is conversant in network protocols which means you can use it to access web sites and services — this will help with web scraping or pulling data from Twitter. There are add-ons contributed by the community that let you make wonderful maps and data visualizations, perform analysis on tabular data (but not in a wonky Excel fashion), and access data stored in a variety of different databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 1990s van Rossum wrote a proposal entitled [\"Computer Programming for Everybody\"](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/). To give you a sense of van Rossum as a designer of technology, consider this passage.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the dark ages, only those with power or great wealth (and selected experts) possessed reading and writing skills or the ability to acquire them. It can be argued that literacy of the general population (while still not 100%), together with the invention of printing technology, has been one of the most emancipatory forces of modern history.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We have only recently entered the information age, and it is expected that computer and communication technology will soon replace printing as the dominant form of information distribution technology. About half of all US households already own at least one personal computer, and this number is still growing.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "However, while many people nowadays use a computer, few of them are computer programmers. Non-programmers aren't really \"empowered\" in how they can use their computer: they are confined to using applications in ways that \"programmers\" have determined for them. One doesn't need to be a visionary to see the limitations here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later he envisions a world with millions or even billions of computer programmers at various levels of proficiency. His is a world where people are not trained by expert-created platforms, but instead have sufficient facility with computation to help shape the software systems around them.\n",
