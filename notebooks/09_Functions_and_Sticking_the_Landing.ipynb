    "So far, we have made a lot of use of the cell structure of your notebooks. We've tried to organize things so that each cell or maybe each \"chapter\" of a notebook accomplishes some task. And we have been encouraging you to make changes to the parameters (chaging URLs, or file names, or picking different numbers) and reuse the code. In short the notebook has let you repeat analysis by creating chunks of text that you can use again on different data. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a little clunky. It's great when you are learning, but it's not the way Python developers think. The main technique to share code is via Python's package mechanism. We have seen packages like Tweepy and Pandas and plotly. The creators of each have provided us with new kinds of objects to accomplish new tasks, from making requests for data on the web to working with tabular data. These objects extend Python's basic functionality and is probably the key to its longevity and broad adoption. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packages consist of simple data, objects and a category of thing we have used but not named -- *functions.* When we use `read_csv()`, for example, we are invoking a function from the `pandas` package that takes as *input* a file name or URL and *returns as output* a DataFrame. When we use `search()` from the package `re`, we are calling a function that takes as *inputs* a string and a pattern (in the form of a regular expression) and *returns* a match object, telling us whether the pattern was found or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are basically blocks of code that we will want to use repeatedly -- in this sense, functions are building blocks to be used in other programs, other notebooks. Ah but functions are blocks in another sense. Remember, Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code, whether it's the commands to be executed over the elements of a list in a `for` loop, or the actions we take when the condition in an `if`-statement is true. \n",
