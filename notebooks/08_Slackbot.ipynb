    "So far, we have a simple newsbot that posts top news headlines to our Slack channel. This is a nice start but we'd really like to query our bot on demand to ask for top headlines, news from a particual site or even news about a particular topic. I won't go as far as calling it \"conversational\" but I'd like our bot to be more interactive. To be able to talk back-and-forth with our Slack bot, we have two options. We can use:\n",

    "Today, we're going to use Slack Events, which allows us to register for certain events we'd like to hear about (a Slack user sends our bot a message, or a someone adds an emoji to a Slack message, for example). When one of the events occurs, Slack will send us a message, letting us know about it. How do they send us the messages you might ask? Well, they send them to us as HTTP requests. Remember from a few lectures back we talked about making HTTP reqeusts? A client (a browser, some python code we write, etc) makes a request for some page or API on a server and the server sends back a response. Is this ringing a bell? Well, in this case, Slack will be sending us HTTP requests each time there an Event occurs that we've asked to be notified about. This means that we get to write our own web service! To do this, we'll be using a python library called [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/). \n",
