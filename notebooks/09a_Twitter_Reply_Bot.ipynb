    "## Our Twitter Reply Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we are going to write a simple Twitter bot. We'd like you to work on the \"brains\" of the bot, coming up with the bot interactions: what does the bot do? what does the user need to send to the bot? how does the bot respond? what data does it need? etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be focusing on the logic of the bot but we need some \"scaffolding\" here - we need the code that will listen to @mentions (for our bot) and will respond to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways for us to write our Twitter bot. In our case, we want our bot to reply to anyone who sends an @mention to our bot, like: \n",
    "\n",
    "`@covidbot what's the covid case count in New York`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Twitter's Realtime API\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our reply bot, we can take two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Twitter's [Realtime (\"Streaming\") API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview/statuses-filter) to be notified of @mentions in realtime, or\n",
    "2. Use Twitter's [`statuses/mentions_timeline` API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-mentions_timeline) to get all @mentions for a user. For this method, you'd need to call the API every few seconds/minutes checking for new @mentions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are pro's and con's to both approach here, but for fun, let's use the Realtime/Streaming APIs. **Note** the example in this notebook is a simple example and would need to be modified to work well as a bot that runs 24x7 without falling over! There is no error checking and I've certainly missed some corner cases - we can discuss in class which of the two approaches you'd take to make this a real bot!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With Twitter's Streaming api, you can \"listen to\" or \"track\" multiple terms or phrases and twitter will send those tweets to us in realtime! it's up to us to respond to the tweets as we see fit. We can also save the tweets in a file, database...or even ignore them if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you could \"track\" phrases like `covid` or `coronavirus` if you want and you'll get a sampling of realtime tweets that contain those phrases. You can also ask to track mentions of `@covidbot` or whatever your bot name is (which is what we'll do). More information about filtering realtime tweets can be found here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview/statuses-filter\n"

    "### Our Bot Function\n",
    "\n",
    "As Mark mentioned in our class notebook, we' want you to write a function that takes a tweet's text and a screen name (or a user summoning our bot) and returns the text that we'd like to send back to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example....if we're building a simple \"echo\" bot that just takes the the incoming tweet text and replies back to the user saying `hi` and echo'ing back what they tweeted at us, we could do this:"
