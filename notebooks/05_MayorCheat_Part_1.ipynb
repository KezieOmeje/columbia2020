    "I think we mentioned that certain voices on Twitter can be counted on for \"mixing things up\" and initiating stories that float through social media looking for traction. The Iowa caucuses were one example of stories appearing quickly in the silence left by missing county results. Margaret Sullivan wrote a nice piece about this, and specifically on how [misinformation and conspiracy theories filled the void.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/social-media-was-a-cesspool-of-toxic-iowa-conspiracy-theories-last-night-its-only-going-to-get-worse/2020/02/04/0df3a9e8-4757-11ea-ab15-b5df3261b710_story.html) [Other outlets](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/481448-iowa-chaos-highlights-new-misinformation-threat) observed and wrote on the phenomenon as well."
