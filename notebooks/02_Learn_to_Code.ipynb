    "\n",
    "**1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have mentioned, in this class our main language for computation will be [Python](http://www.python.org). It was chosen because of its emphasis on **readability and code sharing.** There are plenty of online sources to help you on your journey learning the language, from [cheatsheets](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/) to [online tutorials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python). You will quickly find that the web is a great place to find examples of code to do what you need to do. So, suppose you can't remember how to concatenate two strings...\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A word of caution: Make sure that when you find an answer on the web, it refers to **Python version 3.** There are two popular versions of the language in use, 2 and 3. This is a good example of eventually needing to move on from whatever technological environment you are used to. Apps haave upgrades, your phone's operating system asks to be upgraded, and programming languages evolve. I mean everything can get better, right? We are learning Python Version 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will program in Python (write and execute Python expressions) using the Jupyter notebook — the name \"Jupyter\" being a mix [Julia](http://julialang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the three languages it originally supported. Programming with the notebook is often referred to as **\"literate computing\"** — by that we mean that you code a little, have a look, write a little, come up with more ideas, code a little more, write a little more and so on. To support this, there are two kinds of \"cells\" that one can either write or program in. Think of it as a modern reporter's notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/computationaljournalism/columbia2020/master/images/notebook.jpeg width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The writing is done in **Markdown cells**. Markdown (as opposed to Mark-up) is a language that lets you write in a plain text editor (in this simplest cases the Notepad or TextEdit would work fine too) and there are simple typographical shorthands to **make text bold** or *to put text in italics*. You can also make lists like\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Bread\n",
    "+ Milk\n",
    "+ Dog food\n",
    "+ Swiffer pads\n",
    "\n",
    "These Markdown conventions are then translated into HTML — the upshot being that you don't have to know anything about HTML to create documents that look reasonably good, certainly good enough for your reporting notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Double click in this window to see the \"raw\" Markdown. Notice that you can still recognize lists and emphasized text from the Markdown additions, and that's the other point of this. Your documents, while written in plain text, make use of typographical conventions that make the document's highlighting understandable even without translation to HTML. That's a good trick! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find [the Markdown description here.](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). As we said in the last class, for Monday please go through the [Markdown Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "*To re-render the Markdown in this cell into HTML, click in the cell and hit Shift-Enter to execute the transformation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "One last note. Many organizations (scientific research labs, journalistic organizations, and so on) are \"publishing\" dual works — one that goes into an official journal like Science or The New York Times summarizing a set of computations, and then another that is published in the form of a notebook that documents the author's computational work. Here are some examples from science and journalism.\n",

    "\n",
    "You get the idea. There are an increasing number of projects like this — the fact that you can take someone else's notebook and examine the steps they followed to arrive at their conclusions is, ultimately, an important step toward transparency in data or computational journalism. *The notebooks become objects of coordination.*"

    "Today we are going to branch out from our humble start on Monday and dig more deeply into how we start to build more complex objects into our programming environment and conduct more interesting analyses. In short, we will be learning to code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the heading of \"Why can't we have nice things?\" last year the phrase \"Learn to Code\" and the hashtag `#LearnToCode` was weaponized as part of a meme directed at journalists as an insult. In the wake of the layoffs at news outlets around this time last year, a meme started — \"Learn to code.\" [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/learn-to-code) began tracking it a few days later calling it \"an expression used to mock journalists who were laid off from their jobs, encouraging them to learn software development as an alternate career path.\" \n",

    "Previously the hashtag `#LearnToCode` existed (although used at a low level) to promote sincere efforts encouraging people to take up coding, much in the spirit of this course. The \"Learn to Code\" meme, however, changed things. It evidently found its roots in criticisms of articles about retraining blue collar workers - criticisms portraying the media as out of touch with the working public. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it picked up activity, some suggested that Twitter was even suspending accounts directing this meme at fired journalists. "

    "\n",
    "As we've said, whether we code using a notebook or some other interface, our basic language will be Python. Python is an **object-oriented language**. Software objects are a kind of programming abstraction, a particular way of organizing information and actions. Software objects try to mimic the notion of objects in the physical world — that means they contain properties or **data** and also might have certain operations or **methods** that you can use to transform the object in some way. Take as an example one of our lovely rolling chairs — it has operations (it can support you when you sit, it has a foldable arm for writing, and it can move around the room) as well as \"data\" (it has a seat height, a desk height, maybe even an RGB value specifying its lovely seat color).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python has a series of built-in types of objects, meaning certain types of information that are so basic that they are needed by just about every programming exercise you'll attempt**. Which have we covered so far? As a kind of quiz, write some code that creates a variable having each of the data types we've seen so far using this \"learn to code\" tweet for inspiration. (This is a tweet posted on Sunday at 9:30 NYC time on January 20 of last year, before the phrase took a turn.)"
