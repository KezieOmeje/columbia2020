    "Before we take take a look at APIs, let's take a step back and learn about how the web works. Understanding some of the fundamentals about how information travels around the internet will help us a ton. And, the best place to start is by learning about HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple protocol called [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) powers most of the communications on the web, including your browser and probably most of the apps that you use. HTTP allows you (via your browser, a mobile app or even code you write!) to **request** data (HTML or a web page, PDFs, MP3s, JSON, CSVs, etc.) from a service across the internet (e.g. google.com, twitter.com) and that service will respond with the requested data (i.e. the **response**). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how HTTP in more detail by looking at Mike's slides on \"How the Internet Works.\" You can find the Keynote (for Mac's) or PDF copy of the slides in the docs directory of our github repository."

    "### A Quick Overview of HTTP: Request and Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the tl;dr on how a HTTP request works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A \"**client**\" (your browser, your Instagram app, or even some code that you are about to write) makes a **request** for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The \"**request**\" is in the form of a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (Uniform Resource Locator -- a web address). The URL specifies the site you are requesting information from and the page/document/data you want. For example: https://nytimes.com/ is the URL for the New York Times and this URL https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html specifies a given news story in the form of an HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A \"**server**\" receives the request (e.g. a New York Times server, if you are requesting a nytimes.com URL) and then returns the page/document/data you asked for. This is the **response**. This response can be an HTML page, a PDF, some JSON or CSV data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "One important note: this type of request is called a \"**GET**\" request. There are other types of HTTP requests which we'll learn about later. (The main difference being in how you specify the data you want -- GET specifies the data you want in the URL of the request as we'll see below.) "

There are still issues, like figuring out which table on the page or if everything is formatted properly, but it can be pretty easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot more to learn about HTTP and \"web scraping\" but we'll pick that up in future lessons. For now, let's move on to APIs! With an API we get data, honest to goodness data, and not some piece of a document made to look sorta like data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API, or application programming interface, allows you to specify the data you want and returns it in a computer-friendly format like [JSON](https://www.json.org/) or [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) rather than HTML. The \"interface\" is a regularized way to make requests, and a consistent specification for the data you asked for. So many organizations now publish APIs for their data. From [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to [ProPublica](https://propublica.github.io/campaign-finance-api-docs/), to governmental organizations like the ~~[EPA](https://developer.epa.gov/category/api/)~~, to social media sites like [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) and [Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram/) and [LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea of an API is quite old,** and in fact APIs exist throughout the operating system in your computer. There is an API that lets different applications on your computer access printing capabilities, or communicate via your wireless hardware. These APIs, again, provide application developers with a regularized way to access services. So Word's print screen looks like the print screen from your PDF previewer or even Photoshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Then in time, the services that were being advertised moved from your computer to the web.** So-called \"mashups\" came on the scene that let you feed data from one service into another. To put this in a vague historical perspective, if Web 1.0 meant putting your content online, then Web 2.0 was about cooperation between sites, sharing data via the internet to build new services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Salesforce.com led the way with its API in 2000 (I believe), recognizing that customers needed the same data across different platforms. Ebay followed, providing an API so that others could embed their data and services. Personally, it was the Google Maps' API that really drove the idea home. It appeared in 2006 and immediately spawned a number of mapping mashups. You can read about the history of APIs from [a services perspective](https://history.apievangelist.com/), [as evolution of the mashup](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-mashups/index.html), or as [a technical innovation](http://www.openlegacy.com/blog/the-history-of-apis-and-how-they-impact-your-future), eventually leading back to a [PhD thesis in 2000 by Roy Fieldings](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) laying out the whole scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today there are so many APIs it's hard to keep track. Look at the growth, captured by the \"readmeblog\".\n",

URLs may only contain specific, valid characters (essentially `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`, `.`, `~`, and a handful of other characters). Any characters not in the list of valid characters need to be encoded. You can read a bit more on [URL Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) but, essentially, any characters not in the valid list are encoded using the `%` character followed by the hexidecimal value of the [ASCII character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). In the case of the comma (`,`), it's encoded as: `%2C`. 2C is the hexidecimal value for the comma.\n",

You can add additional variables (up to 50 of them in each request) in your API call by adding them to the `get` URL parameter (hint: it's comma-delimited so make sure you separate new variables with a comma). See our examples above and add additional fields that you'd like to capture. If you want to add more than 50, you can make one request at a time and save the data (to a file!)."
