Sohrab Ahmari New York Post “The Trump Campaign raised $10 million in the two days following the impeachment (Scam) vote. It seems the Democrats have shot themselves in the foot in one more way. They set up a process they know is not going to lead to the Presidents removal &amp;...
....it’s alienating independents. This President is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another and that really plays to his base.” @FoxNews  @cvpayne  Their partisan Witch Hunt is hurting our Country do badly &amp; only bringing more division than ever!
A lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of Dirty (Filthy) Cops politicians government officials and an investigation that was illegally started &amp; that SPIED on my campaign. The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!). If this....
....had happened to a Presidential candidate or President who was a Democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more) and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!

Iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation!
General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many more...but got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number....
....of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!
The United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year for many years. That is on top of all else we have done for them. The people of Iraq don’t want to be dominated &amp; controlled by Iran but ultimately that is their choice. Over the last 15 years Iran has gained more....
....and more control over Iraq and the people of Iraq are not happy with that. It will never end well!
This is a great book a must read! https://t.co/bwpNVi5hpY

95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
As hard as I work &amp; as successful as our Country has become with our Economy our Military &amp; everything else it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time &amp; money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!
Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American &amp; badly wounded many others not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime including recently....
....hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets we have.....
....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago) some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp;  the Iranian culture and those targets and Iran itself WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!
They attacked us &amp; we hit back. If they attack again which I would strongly advise them not to do we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before! https://t.co/qI5RfWsSCH
The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base or any American we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!
These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target the United States will quickly &amp; fully strike back &amp; perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless!
“The reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic.” @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo  The great Scam continues. To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history when I am so busy is sad!
The Impeachment Hoax just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election must end quickly. Read the Transcripts see the Ukrainian President’s strong statement NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!
Congress &amp; the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote &amp; we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!

“FBI Director apologizes for FISA Errors (of which there were far to many to be a coincidence!).” @FoxNews Chris what about all of the lives that were ruined because of the so-called “errors?” Are these “dirty cops” going to pay a big price for the fraud they committed?
Where have the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are “unhinged.”
New polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere. A vast majority want the Do Nothing Democrats to move on to other things now!
Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!
Now the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats are asking @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to do the job that they were unable to do. They proved NOTHING but my total innocence in the House despite the most unfair &amp; biased hearings in the history of Congress. Now they demand fairness!

To the brave long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage.
به مردم شجاع و رنج کشیده ایران: من از ابتدای دوره ریاست جمهوریم با شما ایستاده‌ام و دولت من همچنان با شما خواهد ایستاد. ما اعتراضات شما را از نزدیک دنبال می کنیم. شجاعت شما الهام بخش است.
The government of Iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the Iranian people. There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching.
دولت ایران باید به گروه‌های حقوق بشر اجازه بدهد حقیقت کنونی اعتراضات در جریان مردم ایران را نظارت کرده و گزارش بدهند. نباید شاهد کشتار دوباره ی معترضان مسالمت آمیز و یا قطع اینترنت باشیم. جهان نظاره گر این اتفاقات است.

George @GStephanopoulos ask Crazy Nancy why she allowed Adam “Shifty” Schiff to totally make up my conversation with the Ukrainian President &amp; read his false words to Congress and the world as though I said it? He got caught! Ask why hearing was most unfair &amp; biased in history?
John Kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to Iran were used to fund attacks on the USA. Only a complete fool would have given that 150 Billion Dollars Plus to Iran. They then went on a Middle East Rampage! @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth
Michael Goodwin New York Post: “Trump’s peace through strength philosophy is what America needs. His (John Kerry) claim bears no relation to reality. The Agreement didn’t create opportunities for America &amp; other signatories to confront Iran’s malign activities. It overlooked....
....and then helped to fund them...And zero progress was made on curbing those activities until Trump droned Soleimani...Plainly Trump is not a warmonger. He’s a deal maker &amp; his record is that of someone who uses our military might as a deterrent unleashes it with....
....discretion and only as a last resort.” Thank you to the great Michael Goodwin. Could not have said it better myself!
“Pelosi has made a mockery of Impeachment. Her Articles are so weak. But more importantly she thought she could extort the Senate. She couldn’t.” @GreggJarrett @foxandfriends The Do Nothing Democrats are really run by the Radical Left. Too bad!
Great idea. This phony Impeachment Hoax should not even be allowed to proceed. Did NOTHING wrong. Just a partisan vote. Zero Republicans. Never happened before! https://t.co/47oV6z4RQc
Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress? He must be a Witness and so should she!
Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did nothing wrong. Read the Transcripts! Hose Republicans voted 195-0 plus we got three Dems. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!

Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence no crime read the transcripts “no pressure”  Impeachment Hoax rather than an outright dismissal it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!
National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions &amp; protests have Iran “choked off” will force them to negotiate. Actually I couldn’t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but no nuclear weapons and “don’t kill your protesters.”
مشاور امنیت ملی امروز عنوان کرد كه تحریم ها و اعتراضات، ایران را«به شدت تحت فشار»قرار داده است و آنها را مجبور به مذاكره می كند.در واقع، اصلا برایم اهمیتی نداردکه آیا آنها مذاکره می کنند یا نه.این کاملاً به عهده ی خودشان است، اما سلاح هسته ای نداشته باشیدو«معترضان خود را نکشید.» https://t.co/DBGGs8QFcJ
Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising. I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare you have it now while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive unfair and very unpopular Individual  Mandate.....

Bernie Sander’s volunteers are trashing Elizabeth “Pocahontus” Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?
The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was “eminent” or not &amp; was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES. but it doesn’t really matter because of his horrible past!
The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do whether it’s the economy military or anything else will be scorned by the Rafical Left Do Nothing Democrats!
Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on or in any way denigrate our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it and they walked around it instead. Big progress!

Heading back to Washington from @Davos  Switzerland. Very successful (for USA) trip!
One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA &amp; China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi a man who truly loves his country. Much more to come!

“Schiff doesn’t have a case telling the truth so he’s manufacturing things.” Rush Limbaugh @foxandfriends
“There is no evidence of a crime.” Robert Charles Fmr Asst Secy of State. The crimes were committed by the other side!
Attorney Generals from 21 States are urging the Senate to reject Impeachment. They say the Articles have legal &amp; factual problems and the Democrats case sets a dangerous historical precedent. “EVEN AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT UNDERMINES THE INTEGRITY.....
....OF THE 2020 ELECTION BECSUSE IT WEAPONIZES A PROCESS THAT SHOULD ONLY BE INITIATED IN EXCEEDINGLY RARE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES.” @HeatherChilders @FoxNews The Democrats are trying hard to damage Republicans prior to the Election!
In an Impeachment you can’t use a work of fiction as the theory for the case filling in gaps with presumptions against the President. It was a weak presentation self indulgent &amp; he didn’t deliver the goods.” Robert Charles @HeatherChilders @FoxNews
The Democrat House would not give us lawyers or not one witness but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought or even asked for? They had their chance but pretended to rush. Most unfair &amp; corrupt hearing in Congressional history!
No matter what you give to the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats it will never be enough!
The Democrats &amp; Shifty Schiff whose presentation to the Senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations are refusing to state that the Obama Administration withheld aid from many countries including Ukraine Pakistan Philippines Egypt Honduras &amp; Mexico. Witch Hunt!
Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals. He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is. By doing this he figures they won’t hit him as hard....
....during his hopeless “presidential” campaign. They will remain silent! The fact is when Mini losses he will be spending very little of his money on these “clowns” because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all - and he will be right!
“This is all about undermining the next Election.” Liz Peek @FoxNews
The Democrats don’t want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff the Biden’s the fake Whistleblower(&amp; his lawyer) the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts) the so-called “informer” &amp; many other Democrat disasters would be a BIG problem for them!
The United States looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister @Netanyahu &amp; Blue &amp; White Chairman @Gantzbe to the @WhiteHouse next week. Reports about details and timing of our closely-held peace plan are purely speculative.

“21 State Attorney Generals denouncing the Impeachment of President Trump.” @FoxNews
“He’s got to explain this. How did Hunter Biden get a billion and a half dollars (from China) to invest when he’d been in business for 60 days?” @LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews
Frances Hakes former Federal prosecutor “This is really significant. The FBI had debunked the Steele Dossier in January of 2017 and then even after they did that even after they knew from the CIA &amp; from their own sources they knew that Carter Page was not the agent of
....a foreign power engaged in clandestine intelligence activities and yet they still asked for the renewal two more times and it gave the right for the government to rifle through the Trump campaigns files &amp; Emails Text messages.....” So how bad &amp; illegal is that? @FoxNews
After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House and then having to endure hour after hour of lies fraud &amp; deception by Shifty Schiff Cryin’ Chuck Schumer &amp; their crew looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday which is called Death Valley in T.V.
“I often get asked the question well isn’t the President going to be stronger and harder to beat if he survives this? The answer is yes but the Congress has no choice it has a Constitutional responsibility.” Joe Biden pres. candidate. Even Joe agrees with us! @foxandfriends
The Impeachment Hoax is interfering with the 2020 Election - But that was the idea behind the Radical Left Do Nothing Dems Scam attack. They always knew I did nothing wrong!
Cryin’ Chuck never had what it takes and never will! https://t.co/pQh4lXNCBN
Jim is great! https://t.co/SxjDSlaP7J
More than anything else the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats like AOC Omar Cryin’ Chuck Nervous Nancy &amp; Shifty Schiff are angry &amp; “deranged” over the fact that Republicans are up to 191 Federal Judges &amp; Two Great New Supreme Court Justices. Don’t blame me blame Obama!
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
The Do Nothing Democrats just keep repeating and repeating over and over again the same old “stuff” on the Impeachment Hoax. They want to use up ALL of their time even though it is the wrong thing to do. They ought to go back to work for our great American people!

A really big show tonight by @seanhannity  9:00 P.M. @FoxNews  Heavy emphasis on the Impeachment Hoax. The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have gone crazy. They know it’s a con but just can’t sell it! Public strongly against Impeachment.
Check out @seanhannity now on @FoxNews. Big tonight!
The Great @LouDobbs: “People know after 3 years of this President the most historic President in our Country’s history that there is no one who can touch what he’s done in 3 years foreign policy domestic policy you name it it’s amazing. Just to have the guts not to be.....
....intimidated by this national left wing media that reduces most politicians and most public figures to whining crying puddles of cowardice - it is really something to have a man in the White House who has a courageous heart and does what he says he will do.”
“I like President Trump’s Tweets (Social Media) I like everything about him...and this Ukraine stuff the trial the impeachment this isn’t t about Ukraine. Donald Trump has committed the two unpardonable sins in the eyes of the Democrats. He beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and..
....secondly he is fulfilling every promise he made and that is making his opponents apoplectic. They’re trying to get him out of office and they’re not going to succeed.” Pastor Robert Jeffress author of “Choosing the Extraordinary Life”  Thank you Pastor! @LouDobbs @FoxBus

Any fair minded person watching the Senate trial today would be able to see how unfairly I have been treated and that this is indeed the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax that EVERYBODY including the Democrats truly knows it is. This should never be allowed to happen again!

The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before. In just two hours the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have seen their phony case absolutely shredded. Shifty is now exposed for illegally making up my phone call &amp; more!
Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN and probably a very sick man. He has not paid the price yet for what he has done to our Country!

“This is what Democrats have done. They want to create the idea that there is all this smoke so people think there’s fire. They did this with Russia Collusion &amp; there was no fire. It makes zero sense what the Democrats are accusing him of.” @LisaMarieBoothe @foxandfriends
A very good question! https://t.co/8z6uQLKz8M
Why didn’t Schiff release this? https://t.co/ngxEqAIJU9
Great Editorial in today’s Wall Street Journal “And Congress Shall Be King.” Bottom line: “The President becomes a vassal of King Congress. This is another reason for the Senate to repudiate this House Impeachment as its own abuse of power.” A partisan Hoax!
“Again: Read the Transcript!” Michael Goodwin New York Post Sunday.
After having been exposed as a fraud and corrupt can anyone including Sleepyeyes Chuck Todd of Fake @NBCNews continue to listen to his con?
Sleepyeyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Corrupt Press just had a “totally” softball interview with conman Adam Schiff never even calling Shifty out on his fraudulent statement to Congress where he made up ALL of the words of my conversation with the Ukrainian President! FAKE NEWS
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! 191 Federal Judges (a record) and two Supreme Court Justices approved. Best Economy &amp; Employment Numbers EVER. Thank you to our great New Smart and Nimble REPUBLICAN PARTY. Join now it’s where people want to be!

Reports are that basketball great Kobe Bryant and three others have been killed in a helicopter crash in California. That is terrible news!
Kobe Bryant despite being one of the truly great basketball players of all time was just getting started in life. He loved his family so much and had such strong passion for the future. The loss of his beautiful daughter Gianna makes this moment even more devastating....
.....Melania and I send our warmest condolences to Vanessa and the wonderful Bryant family. May God be with you all!
