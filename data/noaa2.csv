Thanks for info.  From what I can see, office did nothing wrong unless they were off script with official NWS forecast.  The public was confused and they attempted to clarify information being attributed to unknown sources.  Hoping we can let this go to focus on more immediate Comms.  FYI, saw this this morning: The National Weather Service corrected Trump after he falsely claimed that Hurricane Dorian will hit Alabama

US President Donald Trump receives a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) on Hurricane Dorian in Washington, DC, on September 1, 2019. The National Weather Service in a tweet Sunday said that Hurricane Dorian is not expected to hit the state of Alabama, directly contradicting a false claim from US President Donald Trump. Earlier President Trump tweeted that: ""In addition to Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much)

We received this request from the Washington Examiner. I would assume that PA would like to handle this one?

As I mentioned in the email to the staff Sunday evening, the general timeline was as follows: Day shift on Sunday starts to receive a large/inordinate amount of calls and post/questions on social media about possible impacts in Alabama (from Dorian).

(Twitter/FB) to let folks know that Dorian does not appear to be a threat for the state.

(b)(6) send out a note on social media

Some time later (they estimate about 10 minutes), the staff is made aware of the POTUS tweet when James Spann direct responds to the POTUS Tweet. That was the first time the staff in the office saw it.

So, in short, our tweet/FB post was to try and dispel rumors and not in ""direct"" response to the POTUS.","Tuesday","September 3, 2019 2:33 PM","September 3, 2019","2:33 PM",2019-09-03 14:33:00,5,1567535580

This was from yesterday to a generic email account. Do we need to respond at this point? If yes, I am okay with you responding using the statement that NWS Birmingham responded to inquiries and to assure the public that Alabama was not in the projected path.

For background for us. This is the official statement regarding the statement on Sunday.  Alabama Impacts from Hurricane Dorian: 

According to the National Hurricane Center’s late morning update – released just prior to the President’s briefing – a small portion of the southeast coast of Alabama could in fact see some tropical storm force wind and rainfall impacts as a result of Hurricane Dorian.

As we have seen over the past week, storm tracks can change quickly and everyone in the potential path of the storm, as well as neighboring states, should continue to monitor the weather for the most up-to-date information.

Question: Wondering if there’s any idea as to where the chart the President held up a short while ago in a briefing with McAleenan may have come from? We’re particularly trying to determine where the black mark over a part of southern Alabama and northwestern Florida might have come from. We’re not seeing this picture with the black semi-circle looking mark on any of the NHC forecasts or NOAA projections for Dorian.

Hope you’re well. Was curious, did the NOAA ever produce a map that the president displayed today at the White House, where it appears that Alabama is highlighted in sharpie or marker of some sort as being in the path of Hurricane Dorian?

Hello, my name is Audrey McNamara, I am a reporter at The Daily Beast. I'm reaching out about a map of Hurricane Dorian’s trajectory presented by President Trump today that has raised some questions. The map appears to have an additional line including Alabama that is not on NOAA’s projections. Is President Trump’s map correct? If not, why not?

In a shot of President Trump in the Oval Office, he's holding up a map of Hurricane Dorian's path which seems to include a drawn-on bubble including Alabama in the storm's range. Is Alabama now likely to be hit by the storm? Was the White House instructed to change maps to reflect that change?

President Trump just held up during a briefing on Hurricane Dorian (a screenshot is attached). The path of the storm is outlined in white, but there’s a black circle that extends farther west over Alabama. Was that black circle in the original forecast made by the government?

Good afternoon,


I'm wondering if the National Weather Service/NOAA has any comment on a map with NOAA and NWS

logos used by the president in a briefing today. Does the possible trajectory seemingly drawn onto the map

represent any trajectory NWS has ever had for Dorian? You can see the black line extending to Alabama

here in the screenshot below from C-SPAN.


Thank you.

Interesting excerpt:


It was Trump who used a black Sharpie to mark up an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration map, which he displayed during an Oval Office briefing on Wednesday, according to a

White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.


“No one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,” the official said of the map, which

added Alabama into the hurricane’s potential pathway inside the loop of the marker.

Subject: Social media reaction - Friday


The modified hurricane track map continues to dominate @NOAA mentions on Twitter overnight and into

this morning. The majority of the mentions are critical of the administration for altering the map with

multiple comments berating the WH statement by RADM Brown. There are also several comments

referring to the NHC forecast archive as evidence refuting the claim that Alabama was in danger. The

number of comments voicing disappointment that NOAA hasn't replied directly have dropped dramatically

compared to the previous 24 hours. NOAA and NHC Facebook accounts continue to be calm with a handful

of comments on posts, none critical of NOAA.

You know, I've never noticed the oddities of the time stamps but now that you mentioned it. Going back and looking at them they are definitely off. The tweet, from what I understand, went out at 10:11 AM.  That matches the FB post time (see attached). The settings on tweetdeck must be off.  

Talking to the day shift, somewhere between 9 AM and 10 AM the phones started ringing off the hook with people asking questions about why/when the forecast had changed and when Alabama would be impacted.

We also received several direct messages on social media.

That prompted the tweet/FB post.

The staff didn't know about the POTUS tweet until James Spann direct responded to him. That showed up on our wall. That was some time later from what I understand.

The nation’s meteorologists saw the extended presidential eruption as an unhelpful diversion from a serious

threat,” Politico’s Nancy Cook reports. “‘There is a potentially life-threatening hurricane headed for the

Carolinas, and any distraction from making people aware of the potential consequences is not doing anyone

a favor,’ said Dan Sobien, president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. ‘This is a

distraction from what the official government message should be right now.’ Sobien said the union

representing the National Weather Service has fielded numerous calls over the past 24 hours from

managers from the weather service, private-sector businesses and union members asking how the

National Weather Service can stop the president from continuing to repeat confusing information — or

worse, undermining the fact-based reports from the Miami-based hurricane forecasters.”","Friday","September 6, 2019 12:38 PM","September 6, 2019","12:38 PM",2019-09-06 12:38:00,175,1567787880

This is clearly demonstrated in Hurricane Advisories #1 5 through #41 , which can be viewed at the following link.  

The Birmingham National Weather Service’s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.  

NOAA's mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun, and to conserve and manage our coastal and marine resources.

An official statement has been sent out to media from NOAA this afternoon. Let me just say I am extremely proud of the work each of you do each day to support Alabama and deliver the mission.

NWS spokeswoman Susan Buchanan wrote back saying the latter was true.

Team NWS -

First and foremost, we would like to thank each and every one of you for your commitment and outstanding work on everything from travel arrangements to infrastructure support to forecasts and warnings during the long course of Hurricane Dorian.  You put your shoulders to the wheel every
day - starting with ensuring the Puerto Rico radar was up, and continuing through to efforts today to ensure all are braced for wind, surge and surf impacts in the Northeast. Yet again, we saw tremendous forecasts and amazing IDSS at every level and every turn (NCEP Centers, FOs, RFCs, Water Center, etc) even in the face of a unique, complex and uncertain forecast.  We also saw actions taken through the night to quickly restore resilience and robustness to our information architecture. We are absolutely amazed at how you all pulled together to support one another to ensure consistent messaging in addition to putting the most accurate information science allows in the hands of key decision makers who are making life/death decisions.

Given the possible tracks and impacts of this storm, our warnings and the subsequent evacuations demonstrated everything we have been working towards -- continuously updated information, clear messaging of scenarios, and calls to action to create near precision level evacuations.  Now we know... not only is it possible... it is doable and repeatable.


We recognize this peak effort takes a toll, however, and requires rest and recovery as we prepare forecasts for several more storms in the wings of the Atlantic and Pacific, not to mention continued fires, monsoons, and heat across the full breadth of our geography. Suffice it to say, it takes the entire team to achieve these repeated levels of success and we want you all to know it is recognized and appreciated.

 The NWS leadership team is thankful and proud of your service, expertise and relentless dedication. You are leading us into the future - and displaying clearly what building a Weather Ready Nation looks like.  We honorably met the mission, and have shown how vital the NWS is to dedication.

Dr. Gallaudet,


I cannot stress the far reaching impact the NOAA’s statement today undermining previous hurricane warnings impact on Alabama from Dorian will have on the level  of public trust toward the NOAA and meteorologists in general.  

It is sad that scientists have become puppets of an oligarch. I am raising two sons in Florida and rely on facts to dictate our hurricane evacuations. This makes me pause.  Your five day late statement will also make my 13 year old son, who wants to be a meteorologist, realize that such a career endeavor will be riddled with political infections and perhaps, should be abandoned. He can spend his genius on more academic pursuits.  Saddened by the NOAA’s lack of backbone,

Subject: Our Appreciation for the NWS Performance for Dorian


From:  Louis W. Uccellini, Director and Mary Erickson, Deputy Director


and the Executive Council - John Potts, John Murphy, Kevin Cooley, Peyton Robertson


Team NWS -

First and foremost, we want to acknowledge the challenging and trying time

we have been through for Hurricane Dorian.  This storm presented forecast

and warning challenges and tremendous stresses and strains to our

workforce, given its complexity, duration and its toll on our time and talent.

We want to assure you that we stand behind our entire workforce and the

integrity of the forecast process, including the incredible scientific, technical

and engineering skill you demonstrated for this event.  Your commitment and

outstanding work were on display in everything we did from infrastructure

support to forecasts and warnings to working with our core partners,

providing travel logistics...and more during the long course of Hurricane

Dorian.


You put your shoulders to the wheel for this hurricane---starting with ensuring

the Puerto Rico radar was up, and releasing extra radiosondes throughout

most of the event. Your tireless work ensured all partners and the general

public were ready and responsive for wind, heavy rain, flash floods, storm

surge and surf impacts, violent tornadoes and high wind and waves over the

open ocean as Dorian moved toward Puerto Rico, then from the Bahamas

toward and along the Florida coast, toward the Mid Atlantic region and finally

toward the Northeast into Canada. We saw tremendous forecasts, warnings

and amazing IDSS and public outreach at every level (NHC, other NCEP

Centers, WFOs, RFCs, Water Center, ROCs and CWSUs) and at every turn,

even in the face of a unique, complex and uncertain forecast.  We also saw

actions taken through the night to quickly restore resilience and robustness

to our information architecture. We are absolutely amazed at how you all

pulled together to support one another to put the most accurate information

science allows and put your best judgements into the hands of key decision

makers who are making life/death decisions.


Given the possible tracks and impacts of this storm, our warnings and the

resulting responses by the public safety officials up and down the East

Coast, including focused evacuations, all demonstrated everything we have

been working towards---continuously updated information, clear messaging


of scenarios, and calls to action to support near precision level evacuations.

International, Federal, State and local officials were at our side the entire

time, listening and making impact-based decisions with a high level of



International, Federal, State and local officials were at our side the entire

time, listening and making impact-based decisions with a high level of

specificity and at the right time to protect lives and property.  Now we

continue to see... not only is it possible... you are making it happen.


We saw first hand that our integrated forecast process works, and we

continue to embrace and uphold the essential integrity of the entire forecast

process as it was applied by ALL NWS offices to ensure public safety first

and foremost.  Suffice it to say, it takes the entire team to achieve these

repeated levels of success and we want you all to know it is recognized and

honored.


The NWS leadership team is proud of your service, expertise and relentless

dedication to our mission. You are leading us into the future---and displaying

clearly what building a Weather Ready Nation looks like.  We honorably met

the mission of the NWS for Dorian, and have again shown how vital the NWS

is to public safety.


We are grateful to each and every one of you, each and every day.


-- Louis, Mary, and the NWS Executive Council - John Potts, John Murphy,

Kevin Cooley, Peyton Robertson

I concur with your assessment. However, it was bigger than just Dorian. We had wildfires ongoing in the west, developing tropical systems in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins and had other areas of thunderstorms to watch. I would modify it slightly. Our mission is supposed to be apolitical.

"Craig McLean - NOAA Federal","Alabama","noaa_email_119.txt","For an agency founded upon and recognized for determining scientific truths, trusted by the public, and responsible in law to put forward important science information, I find it unconscionable that an anonymous voice inside of NOAA would be found to castigate a dutiful, correct, and loyal NWS Forecaster who spoke the truth.  The science based information product that this Forecaster offered to the public after unnecessary, unqualified, and confusing information was inappropriately distributed by unqualified parts of the Government, was to correct the misunderstanding and further safeguard the public from inaccurate information, and unnecessary alarm.

The best I can tell is that this press release is a product of the Public Affairs machinery.  Please, please, don't tell me that the quality review of the performance of the agency's technical expertise of our scientists in NOAA including the National Weather Service Forecasters, will now reside in the hands of the Public Affairs apparatus of either NOAA or the DOC. Remarkably, our forecaster signs his work.  At least his critics should too.

What concerns me most is that this Administration is eroding the public trust in NOAA for an apparent political recovery from an ill timed and imprecise comment from the President.  I hope that NOAA's trust in the public eye will outlast this Administration, but until then I harbor a great concern for all scientists, science missions, and the quality of our public communications about our research in that a spurious press release may accompany any future scientific conclusion, be it a weather forecast, a climate study, or an ocean and fisheries forecast.  This is an alarm bell that needs to sound inside the agency, around the false prophet of stewardship from the Department of Commerce, and outside the agency.  Most important, is that our employees need to know that we stand for science, not politically motivated apologies.

This is a serious situation.","Saturday","September 7, 2019 8:28 PM","September 7, 2019","8:28 PM",2019-09-07 20:28:00,284,1567902480

I have to tell you that to a person, the folks on duty were very positive and really appreciated the personal touch on a weekend shift.

Many enjoyed sharing some of the tricky elements of the forecast, and we discussed local impacts.

I know we caught them a bit off guard, so also mentioned they could follow up if they had questions.

"Nicole LeBoeuf - NOAA Federal","NOS' Response to Hurricane Dorian","noaa_email_136.txt","Good afternoon NOS,


I am writing to express to you how deeply grateful I am for NOS’s and for NOAA’s collective response to Hurricane Dorian. I could not be more proud of how well we performed and continue to perform as much of the work, particularly for NOS, is just getting started.


NOS employees' performance leading up to and during Hurricane Dorian was and remains exemplary. Last week wasn't easy for any of us caught up in the human and environmental impacts associated with this event. To give you a partial sense of the scale of Hurricane Dorian's footprint on NOS and our partners, we activated our Incident Management Team, multiple National Marine Sanctuaries and National Estuarine Research Reserves closed operations, we issued our Quick Looks product, we activated our Disaster Preparedness Program, we contributed to the deployment of gliders to better understand storm intensification, and we utilized real-time information from our newly launched Coastal Inundation Dashboard, as well as our tried and tested Environmental Response Management Application. We participated in multiple times a day briefings and, at one point, we had over 300 employees (including contractors, NOAA Corps Officers, and Sea Grant fellows) in the area of impact.


Many of our staff and partners found themselves under local or state mandatory evacuation orders as we embedded others at FEMA’s National Response Coordination Center. Across NOAA, but particularly at NOS, during storm events, some employees find themselves securing facilities and ensuring that staff are safe as others position teams and assets to move into these same areas to assess damage and begin the long, hard work of helping communities recover what's been lost. With all of our Mission Essential Functions now pre- authorized by FEMA, NOS’ National Geodetic Survey and the Office of Coast Survey’s Navigational Response Teams are collecting coastal imagery and conducting hydrographic surveys in FL, GA, SC, and NC. Most importantly at NOS, we have no indications of any injuries or major damage throughout our workforce or facilities nor those of our partners.

The potential seriousness of impacts from coastal hazards, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, should never be underestimated nor trivialized. When NOAA’s National Weather Service issues watches and warnings, like the general public, we must take them to heart. The destruction and loss of life in the Bahamas is a reminder of the havoc these powerful systems can wreak on coastal communities. I’m not a stranger to this notion as I grew up along the Texas coast, experiencing multiple storm events. I’ve packed my bags, boarded up my house, driven through the night to safety, and then driven home to uncertainty.

People living along the U.S. east coast experienced these or similar events as Hurricane Dorian approached.  They relied upon NOAA, including NOS’ products and services, to give them the insights they needed to make difficult choices for themselves and their families. These people included not only the general public, but NOS’ own employees, our partners, and many in our extended NOAA family.  Like many of you, as Dorian turned northward after savaging the Bahamas, my heart was with friends and family in the shifting area of impact. From Florida to the Carolinas, I was on the phone with loved ones daily as they decided whether or not to evacuate, what to take with them if they left, and about the potential for the damage they might come home to. As Dorian approached, I spoke with NOAA colleagues across the as they decided whether or not to evacuate, what to take with them if they left, and about the potential for the damage they might come home to. As Dorian approached, I spoke with NOAA colleagues across the southeast United States as they also prepared for the storm - either in their personal lives, as professionals, or both. It is because much of NOAA lives and works in coastal communities that the whole of our lives are impacted by coastal hazards. It is because I consider NOAA part of my family that I reached out to colleagues at the NWS’s National Hurricane Center, at OAR’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, at NOAA’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, and elsewhere across the agency to check in on them and to offer words of support and encouragement.

Across NOAA, we’ve dedicated our lives to collect, analyze, and disseminate information critical to saving the lives of others. We stand by that information not only because we know it to be the most accurate and authoritative available, but because we also may live and work in harm's way during any given event. This is what's called having skin in the game - a vested interest in the quality of our work and in the trust the public places in us as NOAA employees and as members of local communities. Those we serve are often our friends and neighbors. When we place a NOAA logo on the side of a building and come to work each day, we send a very powerful signal to all - “We are here with you, we are doing all we can to understand the potential risks of environmental and man hazards, and we will share with you the best information we have so that we all might remain safe.”

Because of the accuracy and reliability of the tools and data that NOAA and NOS provides, the American people are enabled to live and prosper in the coastal zone and across our great nation. Our data and information are not only authoritative, but we strive to make how we collect, analyze, and use these data transparent to the public - a hallmark of dedicated public service and of our scientific and professional ethics. The continued public trust in NOAA and in NOS is of paramount importance, and I want to recognize the men and women across NOAA and NOS for their responsiveness, professionalism, commitment to service, as well as to their love of the organization.

As a 22-year NOAA employee, I could not be more proud of how we prepared for, responded to, and will continue to aid recovery from this complex storm and recent challenging events associated with it. I am hopeful that NOAA’s response to Hurricane Dorian, a clear display of courage and commitment and of what it means to us to wear the NOAA logo, will serve as a reminder of what the NOAA mission means not just to us, but to the American people.

I have honorably served NOAA for most of my adult life and am fully invested in its continued success. It is because of ALL of us who embody NOAA's slogan of science, service, and stewardship that I am certain that our world-class reputation will endure beyond these challenging times.
